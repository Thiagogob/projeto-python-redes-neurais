# Characters classifier using neural networks



# :scroll: About
This project involved developing an interactive application to create and test neural network models for character classification. The main goal was to compare the accuracy of two distinct approaches:

RGB-based Model: Identifies characters using user-provided RGB values, ideal for more direct pattern recognition.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: Utilizes CNNs to handle the visual complexity of characters, overcoming the limitations of simple color distinction.

The technologies used were Python (primary language), TensorFlow (for model building and training), Pandas (for data manipulation), and Tkinter (for the graphical user interface). This project was a valuable experience for enhancing skills and reinforcing the importance of choosing the right approach for AI challenges.
